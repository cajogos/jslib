# SEESAW JS

Seesaw is a JavaScript MV\* (model-view-whatever) framework which allows for the creation of always running Web Applications using functions similar to Java\'s Swing library.

## From JS to HTML

The idea is to be able to create web applications that can run at a native 60fps, on modern web browsers, and be able to process real-time information, provided here by 
WebSockets or JSON.

If you want to help out, just report any issues found or if you want to contribute just make a pull request.
